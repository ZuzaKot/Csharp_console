Let�s get started with GitHub!
Make changes to a file and push them to GitHub as commits
What is GitHub?
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. 
This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests. 
You�ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub�s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.
To complete this tutorial, you need a GitHub.com account and Internet access. 
You don�t need to know how to code, use the command line, or install Git (the version control software GitHub is built on).
GitHub makes it easy to add one at the same time you create your new repository. 
Branches accomplish similar goals in GitHub repositories.
Here at GitHub, our developers, writers, and designers use branches for keeping bug fixes and feature work separate from our main (production) branch. 
On GitHub, saved changes are called commits. 
Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub.
